# Precis AI

## Project Summary

**Precis AI** is a social media marketing automation platform that leverages AI/ML to enhance engagement and streamline post generation across multiple social media platforms. The application allows users to input text, which is then summarized, and social media posts are generated from the summarization. This content can be directly posted and scheduled on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Facebook, and Instagramâ€”all from a single interface. 

The project combines artificial intelligence with practical marketing tools, creating a new approach to social media marketing by automating the creation of relevant content that improves outreach and engagement.

### Key Features:
- Summarization of user-provided text into concise briefs.
- AI-generated social media posts based on the summarized content.
- Integration with multiple social platforms for direct posting and scheduling.
- Image generation for posts using DALL-E 3.
- Video and audio transcription using OpenAI Whisper.
